# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## 题目
　　Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.</br>
　　If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell</br>
one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.</br>
　　Example 1:</br>
　　Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]</br>
　　Output: 5</br>
　　max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)</br>
　　Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]</br>
　　Output: 0</br>
　　In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.</br>
